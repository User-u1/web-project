      <h2>My Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Nicolás Martínez Djekic, I am 18 years old and a true
        blend of cultures. Born and raised in Spain, I carry the vibrant
        heritage of being half Colombian and half Serbian, with British
        nationality. This unique mix has shaped who I am and the way I see the
        world. If I had to sum myself up in three words, they'd be funny,
        easy-going, and creative-qualities that drive my approach to both life
        and work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm passionate about basketball and proud to be a part of my
        university's basketball team. The court is where I feel most alive, and
        I enjoy the game and challenges it brings. When I'm not shooting hoops,
        I immerse myself in music. Whether it's producing or just listening,
        music is my escape and a constant source of inspiration. It fuels my
        creativity, and I'm always exploring new sounds and ways to express
        myself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm always excited to connect with new people and experience what the
        world has to offer, constantly learning and growing along the way.
      </p>

      <h2>Basketball</h2>
      <p>
        Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
        players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with
        the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's
        hoop.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in
        Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States, basketball has evolved
        to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports. The
        National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant
        professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity,
        salaries, talent, and level of competition. Outside North America, the
        top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships
        such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The
        FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are
        the major international events of the sport and attract top national
        teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions
        for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.

      <h2>FIBA World Cup</h2>
      <p>
        The FIBA Basketball World Cup is an international basketball competition
        between the senior men's national teams of the members of the
        International Basketball Federation (FIBA), the sport's global governing
        body. It takes place every four years and is considered the flagship
        event of FIBA.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The tournament structure is similar, but not identical, to that of the
        FIFA World Cup; the current format of the tournament involves 32 teams
        competing for the title at venues within the host nation. The FIBA
        Basketball World Cup and the FIFA World Cup were played in the same year
        as each other from 1970 through 2014. A parallel event for women's
        teams, now known as the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, is also held
        quadrennially. From 1986 through 2014, the men's and women's
        championships were held in the same year, though in different countries.

      <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" aims to provide a global vision
        of Computer Engineering in both academic and professional points of
        view. The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals on which
        this engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and
        ethics), the future professional careers and the role of a computer
        engineer in today's society.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the
        theoretical foundations, while the second helps develop practical
        skills.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        1) Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical
        perspective: past, present and future of Computer Engineering. Computer
        Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor:
        anthropological and ethical foundations
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        2) Information and Data: Information representation. Organization of
        information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        3) Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals,
        current paradigms and trends in computer systems and applications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical
        skills where an introduction to web development is addressed, through
        the realization of a project for the creation of a web page on contents
        related to the course.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills,
        this course contributes to the development basic soft-skills for an
        engineer, such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills,
        both oral and written, of technical information, favouring the
        comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in the educational
        project of the University.
      </p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        The specific objectives of this course are designed to equip students
        with a comprehensive understanding of the field of Computer Engineering:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Grasp the essential objectives of Computer Engineering, its ultimate
        goals, and the value it brings to society, while contemplating the role
        you aspire to play as an engineer in the future. Gain knowledge of the
        fundamental principles upon which technological progress should be
        based, with an initial historical perspective on technological
        development. Recognize the importance of the human element in
        professional practice and cultivate a commitment to service and
        contributing to the common good. Achieve a global vision of the field,
        understand its various areas of knowledge, and identify different career
        paths and professional profiles to begin questioning your own vocational
        calling. Acquire knowledge about current paradigms, trends in computing,
        data management, and an introduction to web development.
      </p>
      <br />
